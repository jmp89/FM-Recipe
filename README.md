### What I learned

Actually i am student from an academy called HACK A BOSS, where i learned from their bootcamp at the moment HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript + DOM.

I'll gonna try fill my gitHub repositories with much challenges as possible so i can build a better portfolio.

In this challenge (easy level) i've learned how to apply attributes and create styles on the way, just having an image as reference and that's all in my opinion.

I'm sure that my coding is not clean or light as it can be, but with my experience i think i did a good job.

It took me around 4h30min to finish this challenge!

### Continued development

I'm practicing every day to improve my skills as developer, and the next step in the academy's bootcamp is about backend, so i hope that makes me grow nicely.

I worked in a little project for our academy, practicing everything we already learned.
